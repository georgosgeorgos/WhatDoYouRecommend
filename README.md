- content based (user-based / item-based)

  * preprocessing (using Pandas and NLTK)
  * feature extraction
  * similarity measures 

- collaborative filtering (user-based / item-based)

  * query processing(inverted index)
  * utility matrix
  * k-nearest neighbors 
  * hierarchical clustering
    * dimensionality reduction
  * root-mean-square error
    * Kfold cross-validation

- singular value decomposition approach
  
  * matrix factorization
  * optimization problem (Conjugate gradient method)
  * rmse
  
- TO DO ----> graph approach
